# wpirb: WPILib for the Sparkfun Redbot

WPILib is a library commonly used for programs targeting [National Instruments's roboRIO robotics controller](https://decibel.ni.com/content/docs/DOC-30419), which is the standard platform for the [FIRST Robotics Competition](http://www.usfirst.org/roboticsprograms/frc). This project is an attempt to port at least some of WPILib to [Sparkfun's RedBot](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12697) so that students can learn, prototype, and test their programs more easily.
